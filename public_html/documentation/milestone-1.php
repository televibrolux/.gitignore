		<h1>Rockabilly Guitar</h1>
		<p1>I'm going to write a little bit about me, mainly my hobby and passion, music!! I play bluegrass guitar, dobro, pedal steel guitar
			and the mandolin. I'm also a Fender Telecaster Chickin' Picker! The style of music that I play is bluegrass, country and
			rockabilly in the style of Scotty Moore. Scotty Moore was Elvis Presley's guitar player at his Sun Session Studios where he recorded,
			"That's All Right Mama".</p>
			<h2>My Influences</h2>
			<p2>My influences in the acoustic guitar are Doc Watson and Clarance White. They were both
				bluegrass pickers. In the electric guitar my influences are many. They include Paul Burilson, Don Rich, Cliff Gallup and
				Danny Gatton. What they all have in common is the guitar they play, the Fender Telecaster guitar. The teleaster is
				a versatile guitar that can be played in many styles including country, jazz, shredding and of course chicken pickin'.
				The tele has a very bright and punchy tone that is very distinct. The tele can be heard in countless country and jazz records.
				I was five years old when I heard Buck Owens guitarist chicken pick for the first time and I was hooked.

			<h2>Brief History</h2>
		<p>Rockabilly music began in 1954 when Sam Phillips assembled Bill Black on bass, Scotty Moore on guitar and Elvis Presley
		on vocals and rthym guitar. Those three created magic that would forever change music, especially the lead guitar. Scotty Moore
		would play the tune and the bass at the same time. When he played it sounded like there were two guitars. There was no overdubbing
		in those days, the sound was quite extrordinary to say the least. Everyone wanted to know what kind of guitar Scotty was playing.
		They wanted to recreate the sound they were hearing over the radio. Scotty Moore preferred Gibson guitars because of their mellow
		sound. Another guitar that was used was a Grestch. It was similar to Gibson guitars but both guitars had unique tones. Another band in \
		California, Gene Vincent and the Blue Caps were also making waves. His guitarist Cliff Gallup was playing a Fender Telecaster.
		The Telecaster's tone was not warm at all. It was a very bright (piercing) guitar. The Telecaster became the guitar of choice
		for rockabilly bands because of their sound and because they were so inexpensive compared to a Gibson or Grestch guitar. This was taking
		place in 1955. All of the young kids wanted to sound like Cliff Gallup so they bought Fender Telecaster guitars.
