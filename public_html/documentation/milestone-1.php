		<h1>Rockabilly Guitar</h1>
		<p1>I'm going to write a little bit about me, mainly my hobby and passion, music!! I play bluegrass guitar, dobro, pedal steel guitar
			and the mandolin. I'm also a Fender Telecaster Chickin' Picker! The style of music that I play is bluegrass, country and
			rockabilly in the style of Scotty Moore. Scotty Moore was Elvis Presley's guitar player at his Sun Session Studios where he recorded,
			"That's All Right Mama".</p>
			<h2>My Influences</h2>
			<p2>My influences in the acoustic guitar are Doc Watson and Clarance White. They were both
				bluegrass pickers. In the electric guitar my influences are many. They include Paul Burilson, Don Rich, Cliff Gallup and
				Danny Gatton. What they all have in common is the guitar they play, the Fender Telecaster guitar. The teleaster is
				a versatile guitar that can be played in many styles including country, jazz, shredding and of course chicken pickin'.
				The tele has a very bright and punchy tone that is very distinct. The tele can be heard in countless country and jazz records.
				I was five years old when I heard Buck Owens guitarist chicken pick for the first time and I was hooked.
